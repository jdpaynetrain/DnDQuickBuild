# DnDQuickBuild
 > This is a Java program that will build a 1st level DnD Character using the basic ruleset from 5e
 > This is still a work in progress. I'm using IntelliJ and the JRE is Java Version 11.0.1.
 > Once I implement the last of the 5e rules I will create a makefile to go along with it.
 > Other features I want to implement are:
    1) Be able to create a higher level character.
    2) Implement Feats
    3) When creating a higher level character roll health for each level
 > If you have any suggestions for implementations let me know.
