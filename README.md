# DnDQuickBuild
This was my first attempt at making a D&D character generator. I learned a lot while making this but it devolved into spaghetti code.   

I decided to redo this in C# and plan to expand upon the original idea [here](https://github.com/paynejordand/DndUtils)

This version isn't updated or looked at anymore.
