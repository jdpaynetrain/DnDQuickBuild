# DnDQuickBuild
  This is a Java program that will build a 1st level DnD Character using the basic ruleset from 5e
  
  This is still a work in progress. I'm using IntelliJ and the JRE is Java Version 11.0.1.
  
  Once I implement the last of the 5e rules I will create a makefile to go along with it.
  
  It rolls stats using the rules:
  
    1) Roll 4d6 and take the three highest 6 times
    2) Sum the 3d6 for each stat
    3) If the total sum of the stats or you don't have a stat 15 or higher, roll again
  
  Other features I want to implement are:
  
    1) Be able to create a higher level character.
    2) Implement Feats
    3) When creating a higher level character roll health for each level
    
  If you have any suggestions for implementations let me know.
